            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>Based on the reading for the Tufte I do not think that this visualization is a high resolution because the visualization seems to not show the data as well as a table could. It also is not consistant in defining why each place on the map is important or how much energy it can produce. For example, Scottland focuses on how much of the counties power can/is coming from tidal power whereas other parts that are highlighted, like Chile, say how much energy they are producing. There are even parts that have no data attached to the location and say stuff such as this place has high tides but gives no context on why or how high tides equivalate to the production of power. The other aspect that makes this visualization not seem high resolution is based on the data that they provide. According to the data that they provided they pulled the number 46,000,000 out of thin air. This number in not shown in the data provided where it says that according to one report we have the potential to produce more electricity than we consume but can produce less than half the total energy that humans consume per day.</p>

            <h3>Effects without causes</h3>
            <p> This visualization shows that we could rely on tidal energy but fails to explain why we are not currently using all the potential power. It also fails because it uses the number 46,000,000 MW but does not tell us where it got this number or even what this number represents. Based on some context we could assume that how much we are currently using but once we look at the data table, we see that we are only using 1753 MW. So it does not provide any context of where they got 46,000,000 as well as jumping to the conclusion that just because there is the potential for us to use this energy that there is no for us not to be. This ignores any potenial reason as to why we currently do not wether or not that there is physical limit currently causing us not to.</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p>The creator only uses 1 source of data for how much energy we could produce. They then use this number in order to provide that we could just use tidal power in order to use electricity for the whole world without taking into consideration any physical constraint such as where the majority of this power is being produced and what kind of loss that we would see if we tried to transport that to an area that is farther away from the cost or does not produce enough to support themselves. They want us to try to use more of the tidal power but don’t tell us why we currently are not hitting the projected amount that we can produce. They also do not show where they go the information about how much each location is producing and speculate based on tides height that certain spots will be good with having any evidence to back it up.  They Cherry picked the potential and total electricity produced and consumed but shows in their data table that we are well short of the total energy that humans consume where even their predicted is well short of that total. So the focus in their visualization on the possibility of us relying on the tidal power for electricity but does not bring up total energy because then viewers would see that these tidal power is not as helpgul as they make it out to be.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
