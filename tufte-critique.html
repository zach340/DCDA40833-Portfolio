            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>Based on the reading for the Tufte I do not think that this visualization is a high resolution because the visualization seems to not show the data as well as a table could. It also is not consistant in defining why each place on the map is important or how much energy it can produce. For example, Scottland focuses on how much of the counties power can/is coming from tidal power whereas other parts that are highlighted, like Chile, say how much energy they are producing. There are even parts that have no data attached to the location and say stuff such as this place has high tides but gives no context on why or how high tides equivalate to the production of power. The other aspect that makes this visualization not seem high resolution is based on the data that they provide. According to the data that they provided they pulled the number 46,000,000 out of thin air. This number in not shown in the data provided where it says that according to one report we have the potential to produce more electricity than we consume but can produce less than half the total energy that humans consume per day.</p>

            <h3>Effects without causes</h3>
            <p> This visualization shows that we could rely on tidal energy but fails to explain why we are not currently using all the potential power. It also fails because it uses the number 46,000,000 MW but does not tell us where it got this number or even what this number represents. Based on some context we could assume that how much we are currently using but once we look at the data table, we see that we are only using 1753 MW. So it does not provide any context of where they got 46,000,000 as well as jumping to the conclusion that just because there is the potential for us to use this energy that there is no for us not to be. This ignores any potenial reason as to why we currently do not wether or not that there is physical limit currently causing us not to.</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p>            The creator only uses 1 source of data for how much energy we could produce. They then use this number in order to provide that we could just use tidal power in order to use electricity for the whole world without taking into consideration any physical constraint such as where the majority of this power is being produced and what kind of loss that we would see if we tried to transport that to an area that is farther away from the cost or does not produce enough to support themselves. They want us to try to use more of the tidal power but do not tell us why we currently are not hitting the projected amount that we can produce. They also do not show where they go the information about how much each location is producing and speculate based on tides height that certain spots will be good with having any evidence to back it up.  They Cherry picked the potential and total electricity produced and consumed but shows in their data table that we are well short of the total energy that humans consume where even their predicted is well short of that total. So, the focus in their visualization on the possibility of us relying on the tidal power for electricity but does not bring up total energy because then viewers would see that this tidal power is not as helpful as they make it out to be.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>I feel like this visualization leaves a lot to be desired. I feel like it misses a lot of key points that could be used to improve their argument that this is the future. By Chery picking one estimate of possible overall production then not including it makes me question the integrity of those facts that they used but did not site like the amount of energy produced in Scottland. Because the creator was not consistent with the map and what information they put on their it feels very empty and goes back to Tufte points that humans can read faster than we can talk to having more information is helpful and give a higher resolution to the work and help create a better understanding which is where I feel like this falls Short. I understand that they want us to move towards tidal power, but what advantages does it have over wind and solar with those being easier to install. So, it loses its effectiveness because I don’t know why I should support this over other alternatives. And the visualization only uses 1 of the numbers from the data to support were as the others look made up with no evidence in the data. This calls in the integrity because if one number is false than any of the others are true.</p>
