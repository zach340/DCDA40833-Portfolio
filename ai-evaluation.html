            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I wanted to explore the coding efficiencies because these machines are becoming more capable of coding large projects quickly and with littlehuman inputs. From my experience they can give good large coding blocks that may need some debugging but are much quicker than the human coders. </p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Perplexity</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Perplexity is good about creating code when given exactly what you want or as much detail as you need. Where it comes short is that when given some basic instructions it may miss key details that you felt like were need it get to the final product like it will sometimes skip a step. It also has limitations on how it will format certain parts and knowing the overall code when given this limited input.</p>
            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p> Good uses cases are when you know exactly what you want it to create because then you can work with it to get to what you had pictured in your head.  A poor use case is if you are trying to get it to build something and you do not have the experience or knowledge that it may need to get to what you desire. If you give it minimal directions it does not know what kind of structures you may need. So, if you have an end goal in mind then it will work well for you, but it may not be the best to start if you do not already have some background for what you are trying to get it to do.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>One ethical concern might be what they do with our data. On their website they claim that they do not sell any of your data, but they do track off website activities for better usage of the application. Some data may be used to train AI models and improve the quality of search results, unless you choose to opt out through your Account Settings. So it does collect your input to train but you can opt out of this process.  </p>

            <h2>Tool 2: [Cluade]</h2>
 <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Claude is good about generating code when given some parameters. Now the formatting is not the best because instead of openly showing you the code it hides it in a file that you then must investigate to see what it produced. It does well annotating its code to tell users exactly what each piece is doing but it can be difficult to use when you don’t know what is in each file enough to trust it to use that code. Also has limitations on how it will format certain parts and knowing the overall code when given this limited input. It is slower than some of the other models, but the overall code accuracy is better. </p>
            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p> Good uses cases are when you know exactly what you want it to create and give strict parameters because Claude will get more than necessary and does not always choose the most effective way to do a task. Now if you are willing to be patient and help figure out what it is doing and why then having it coded for you is helpful and can increase efficiency. A poor use case is if you want it to create an image. It will create an image but not very accurately and it will show you the code it used to create the image which is why it is not very good because it was not designed to create these images. </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Claude is trained on publicly available data any user inputs and outputs, private agreements and internally generated material. It will have a more analytical output and will also heavily favor trying to code a solution than most other chat models.  Because of the wording of the terms and services it will use anything that you upload to train the data so it might get very close to a lot of this clause about intellectual property, but when you agree to use it, you agree to allow it to train based on your data. They currently have multiple levels of safeguards and if a new attack comes, they will take notes and correct any potential gaps</p>
